- deaths in Liechtenstein : deaths in Liechtenstein look odd with a value of 0, may be good to also briefly explain that in the figure legend again?

... more confidence in forecasts of incident death than case counts...

[a]is this a COVID specific conclusion because of the unavoidable delays between infections and deaths (and so actions taken today will be quicker to impact cases than deaths), or do we think this conclusion will generally hold? I wonder about other diseases (maybe even other than respiratory ones), or even just a hypothetical situation of deaths being much quicker after becoming a case?
[b]agree, prob also relies on how representative the ascertainment of cases is. At the very start of COVD-19 pandemic, death might have been as hard to predict as cases. And with potential discontinuation of testing going forward, this might become the case again?

... models in terms of appropriate coverage of uncertainty [@funkShorttermForecastsInform2020; @cramerEvaluationIndividualEnsemble2021c]...

[d]this is great and important. Maybe pick this up in a discussion on communication of forecast and its accuracy in times of crisis. An accurate measure of the next move of the pandemic AND and an accurate measure of uncertainty is very important.
